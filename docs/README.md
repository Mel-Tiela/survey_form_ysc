### Context
Because I like to color 🌈 my life with some css on html,  I decided to follow the freecodecamp web design curriculum.   
___Buiding a survey form___ is one of the project requirements and that's why I'm here 😊. 

#### Technologies
Mastering the basics gives me the potential to fly 🕊️so used plain: 
- **html**
- **css** (used grid and flexbox for responsiveness)

#### Set up 
⚠️ _Don't do it only in local. Set your remote repository righ away!_
